Pull from repo and run script 001 AND 002 to get schema locally.


When pushing your work, make directory with your name then:
It should have files named like:
    yourname_sprocs.sql (should contain sprocs you implemented)
Push the directory ONLY, don't push the files you pulled from here if you changed them

Goodnight (7AM btw)
