Note for viewers:
    We understand the repo is messy right now, it's our first team project (in fact first course project basically), please understand too.

A financial transaction model for LUMS (or any institution) that allows for faster transactions at registered vendors by using a localized approach and utilizing the specific LUMS ID as the account ID for everyone (student or not) at LUMS.
USPs:
    - Introduces a brand new pay-online-and-takeaway-at-your-convenience system at all vendors to support people running short on time amidst busy university life
    - Supports potential Rewards Program for regular customers of places like PDC.
    - Visualizes spending data for every user and revenue data for every vendor to help users plan and budget better while supporting vendors to keep tabs on their sales and finances better as well


For Team:
    Pull from repo and run script 001 AND 002 to get schema locally.

    When pushing your work, make directory with your name then:
        It should have files named like:
    yourname_sprocs.sql (should contain sprocs you implemented)
    Push the directory ONLY, don't push the files you pulled from here if you changed them to avoid making changes to other people's work!!!

Goodnight (7AM btw)
